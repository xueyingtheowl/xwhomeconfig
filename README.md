Hi! 

I am currently working at Dr. Edmund C. Lalor's lab for Computaional Cognitive Neurophysiology as a lab technitian/research assistant/lab manager. It's a supportive place with a lot of exciting multisensory research going on and I am involved in a bunch of them to collect and analyze EEG data, contribute in grant applications, and spread our research worldwide.  

I am broadly interested in topics of consciousness, memories, decision making, and attention in the brain and have be exploring how higher cognitive functions interact with language-specific skills for the last year and a half. I came with a mixed background from liberal arts (linguistics, literature, economics) to technical ends (programming, statistics, and natural langauge processing). We will restore a speech production project using both MRI and EEG recently and I can't wait to find a new seashell on the beach of my research question.

I like research and am thinking of sticking to academic careers for a while. However, my long term goal is to start my own company in biomedical science. 

I care about social welfare and justice and hope to find solutions for some challenging human issues. I consider myself as a researcher for questions/solutions instead of a researcher for a specific dscipline. That's to say I learn whatever I can learn and create tools for my probation. 

I like music, art, nature，and some light sports. The world is wide and the life is fantastic, I hold the belief to learn from people and our mother nature as long as I live.
