# Welcome

I am a laboratory technician at Dr. Edmund Lalor's Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab at the University of Rochester. I am interested in understanding the functions of attention and memory in language processing at multi neuroscience levels and improving intelligent conversation systems. 

I am currently responsible for two studies in the lab. One uses fMRI and EEG to explore the speaker and listener's brain and scalp response in conversation. The other aims to find EEG biomarkers for the diagnosis of Autism based on predictive coding theory. Besides, I am also involved in two visual-related EEG research. 

I am an adept learner with a deep emphathy for human society. I see the unlimited power in the intersections of neuroscience, language, AI, and medical science and believe that walking on this path will help me find solutions to social challenges.
