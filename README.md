# Welcome

I am a laboratory technician working at Dr. Edmund Lalor's Computaional Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab at the Univesrity of Rochester. My research interests lie in understanding how higher cognitive functions like attention and memory work during language procesing including speech comprehension and production. I am also interested in applying the findings from neurobiological studies of language to artificial intelligent conversation system. 

Here in the lab I am mainly reponsible for two research projects: one involves using both fMRI and EEG approaches to find same and different brain regions and scalp responses between speaker and listener on daily topics; the other aims to find EEG biomarkers for the diagnosis of Autism based on predictive coding theory. In this study, participants listen to readings of a novel in various intelligibilities.

I had strong interests in neuroscience since high school but haven't have imagined that I would do neuroscience research I've read from books till the first year of my master's study in linguistics. I came to that program with some research experience in natural language processing. And thanks for the education there, I become even clearer of the differences between computaional linguistic research and natural language processing research. Although topics in both fields are exciting, I felt I didn't find my real motivation to continue research. 

Recalling what drove me to pursue computaional linguistic study were the curiosity towards the amazing connections between people's language and thoughts and deep emphathy towards individual's suffering and hope. I realized I care more towards hows and whys on human's cognitive capabilities than creating a delicate engineering system. In other words, computaional approaches for me are more like tools to help me understand people better in the process of seeking solutions to social challenges rather than goals. However as more researchers including me become more advanced in both fields, the boundary between language capability and computaional studies might be less clear in the promising future. 

I started my first cognitive study related to language processing in my thesis research and had promising results using behavioral experiments. Quickly absorbing related knowledge about answering my research question makes me realize the importance of the matching and double testing of neurobiological data with behavioral data. Fortunately my searching of study opportunity for EEG and fMRI soon had a satisfying result and brought me to the current lab I belong to. 

lab work: I learnd the details from design to data analysis of EEG and fMRI experiments
next step: circuit, cellular, system neuroscience, BMI etc.
