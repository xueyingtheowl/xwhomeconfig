# Welcome

I am a laboratory technician at Dr. Edmund Lalor's Computaional Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab at the University of Rochester. I am interested in understanding the functions of attention and memory in language processing in multi neruoscience levels and am also interested in improving intelligent conversation system. 

I am currently reponsible for two studies in the lab. One involves using fMRI and EEG to study speaker and listener's brain and scalp response in conversation. The other aims to find EEG biomarkers for the diagnosis of Autism based on predictive coding theory. Besides, I am also involved in two visual-related EEG research. 

My motivation of doing science origins from finding solutions for social challenges.
